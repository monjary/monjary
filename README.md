# mon-jar-y!

hello hey hi welcome to the github :>\
this is where my code for my stuff goes

## thank you captain obvious

\>:(\
well it could've been not my code, but i swore off stackoverflow since someone was mean to me\
i love making dumb stuff using serious methods and serious stuff using dumb methods\
i have fun with my code and make cool stuff so all is well :D

## bad languages list

- c (it is missing objects)
- c++ (it allows operator overloading)
- c# (it capitalises method names)
- python (it is not statically typed)
- javascript (it doesn't throw enough exceptions)
- lua (arrays start at 1)
- php (string concat operator is .)

## you're just complaining about how they differ from java

yes

## where code

ok you make a good point\
i'm quite protective about my children so if you wish to view source contact me

## version control is for cowards

instead of this overly complicated git thing i just use something called a memory stick, with this method i have only lost an entire codebase ONCE

## this is the opposite of what git hub is for, you should go to plesantindividual decentralised instead

up the shut
